  We wouldnâ€™t dare dish out fashion rules, after all, style comes from knowing
  and celebrating your inner self. As a team of women aged from under thirty to
  over sixty though, we have collectively come to a few fashion realizations
  over the years. Though we each follow our own path and experience different
  journeys, there are a few milestones most women have in common and some style
  mantras we can share.
